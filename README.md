**Disclaimer:**
The proof of concept shown here is for educational purposes only. Automating interactions with third-party websites using RPA should never be done without the explicit approval of the site owner or developer. Unauthorized automation may violate the siteâ€™s terms of service, privacy obligations, or applicable laws. Always seek proper permissions, ensure compliance with healthcare data protection regulations (e.g., HIPAA), and use such approaches responsibly in production environments.  I used this website for the demo purpose and I don't encourage people using this site (https://ccrisktool.cancer.gov/calculator.html) unnecessarily to play around.
